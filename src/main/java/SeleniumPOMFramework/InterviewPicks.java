## what is the strategy you have applied for garbage collection in selenium


    Mentions driver.quit() (not just close() → shows best practice).
    Mentions driver = null for garbage collection eligibility.
    Highlights avoiding memory leaks in parallel execution → makes you sound experienced.
    Clear and concise for interview use.


##     10 Have you ever used crossbrowser testing tools in realtime
    Yes, I have used cross-browser testing tools in real-time projects to ensure our application behaves
    consistently across different browsers and platforms. Specifically, I have integrated Selenium with BrowserStack for cloud-based cross-browser testing, which allowed us to
    run tests on multiple browser–OS combinations without maintaining a large local infrastructure.

    I have also worked with Selenium Grid locally and on
    Dockerized setups for parallel execution on Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.
    This helped us achieve faster feedback on cross-browser compatibility issues
    while reducing execution time significantly. Additionally, I am familiar with tools
    like Sauce Labs and LambdaTest, which provide similar capabilities for scalable,
    cloud-based browser testing."
