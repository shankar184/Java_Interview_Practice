<hr></hr> Interview Answer: Multi-Threading and Cross-Browser Testing in Selenium

In my Selenium framework,
 I have implemented multi-threading using TestNG’s parallel execution feature combined with the
 ThreadLocal WebDriver design pattern.
This ensures that each test runs in its own isolated thread with a separate WebDriver instance,
avoiding session conflicts when multiple tests execute simultaneously.

For cross-browser testing, I have:


Parameterized the browser type in testng.xml.
Implemented a WebDriver factory that dynamically initializes Chrome,
 Firefox, or Edge based on the parameter passed.
Set up Selenium Grid to distribute tests across multiple machines and
browsers in parallel.
This approach allows us to achieve true parallel execution across
different browsers, significantly reducing test execution time while ensuring
broader compatibility coverage.

✅ Key Points Covered in the Answer:

Mentions ThreadLocal + Parallel Execution → shows you understand thread safety.

Mentions Parameterization & WebDriver Factory → highlights framework design knowledge.

Mentions Selenium Grid → demonstrates scalability.

Sounds confident and practical, as interviewers prefer real implementation details.
